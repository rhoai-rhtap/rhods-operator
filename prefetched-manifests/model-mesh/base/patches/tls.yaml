# This patch enables server-auth TLS for external connections
# to the gRPC service. The same certificates will also be used to
# secure internal communcation between the model-mesh pods.
#
# It can be used in conjunction with a kustomize secretGenerator,
# for example include in your overlay kustomization.yaml:
#
# secretGenerator:
#   - name: model-mesh-tls-secret
#     type: kubernetes.io/tls
#     files:
#     - tls.key
#     - tls.crt
#
