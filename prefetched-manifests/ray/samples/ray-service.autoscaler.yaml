  # The workload consists of two applications. The first application checks on an event in the second application.
  # If the event isn't set, the first application will block on requests until the event is set. So, to test upscaling
  # we can first send a bunch of requests to the first application, which will trigger Serve autoscaling to bring up
  # more replicas since the existing replicas are blocked on requests. Worker pods should scale up. To test downscaling,
  # set the event in the second application, releasing all blocked requests, and worker pods should scale down.
